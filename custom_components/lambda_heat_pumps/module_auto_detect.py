"""Finding out which modules a controller has.

A Lambda system is built from modules — heat pumps, boilers, buffers, solar
modules, heating circuits — each occupying its own block of registers. The
controller does not report how many of each are installed, but it refuses to
read the block of one that is not there, which is answer enough.
