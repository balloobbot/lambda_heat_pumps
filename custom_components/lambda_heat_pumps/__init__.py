"""The Lambda Heat Pumps integration.

The integration owns the Modbus link: it opens one connection to the controller,
takes a unit handle on it, and hands that to the `lambda_modbus` device library.
Which modules the controller has is discovered here, once, by probing it — a
Lambda system's hardware is fixed, so there is nothing for the user to configure
and nothing to re-detect until the entry is reloaded.
