"""Base entity for the Lambda Heat Pumps integration.

Every module the controller has — each heat pump, boiler, buffer, solar module
and heating circuit — is its own sub-device, linked to the controller via
`via_device`. The two always-present sub-systems (ambient and the e-manager)
belong to the controller itself.

The unique-id shape here is load-bearing: it is what keeps an existing
installation's entities attached to their history.
