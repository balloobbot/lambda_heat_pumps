"""Polls the Lambda controller and tracks what has to be derived from it.

Two things are read on a schedule:

* The **full poll** refreshes the whole register model in one pooled set of block
  reads. Entities read their values straight off it.
* The **fast poll** reads two registers per heat pump — the operating state and
  the compressor rating. A compressor start can begin and end well inside one
  full-poll window, so the cycle counters would miss it otherwise.

The rest of this module exists because two things cannot be read from the
controller at all: how many times it has entered a mode, and how much energy it
spent in each one. Both are derived from what the polls see and kept here as
totals counted **since Home Assistant started**. A counter entity restores its
own value across restarts and adds on whatever has been counted since — so
nothing here has to be persisted.
